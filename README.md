# Crime Data Regression Analysis

This project implements **Ridge** and **Lasso Regression** models to predict violent crime rates using the **Communities and Crime** dataset.  
It demonstrates how regularization impacts model coefficients, feature selection, and predictive performance.

---

## Project Overview
The project focuses on exploring linear regression techniques with **L2 (Ridge)** and **L1 (Lasso)** regularization.  
It evaluates how changing the regularization parameter (`alpha`) affects:
- The number of non-zero features  
- The model’s R² score  
- The balance between bias and variance  

---

## Features
- Load and clean the Communities & Crime dataset
- Train and evaluate Ridge and Lasso regression models
- Apply Min-Max scaling for feature normalization
- Analyze the effect of different alpha values
- Display top predictive features and their weights  

---

## Techniques Used
- **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**  
- **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)**  
- **Feature Scaling using MinMaxScaler**  
- **Model Evaluation using R² Score**

I’m currently in the process of uploading my previous projects and doing my best to make them publicly available in an organized and clear manner.  

At the moment, I’m adding each project with some **light updates and clarifying adjustments**, and I plan to include more **comprehensive notes, explanations, and detailed READMEs** very soon — to help others better understand each project’s idea and usage.  

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would simply like to connect, I’d be delighted to hear from you:
